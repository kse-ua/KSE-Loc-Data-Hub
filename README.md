# Decentralization Reform in Ukraine (2014 -2022)

The project investigates the effects of restructurization of local councils (i.e. "rada", N = 11,250) into amalgamated territorial communities (i.e. "hromada", N = 1,469) and the effect of this tranformation on key macroeconomic and psychosocial indicators. Of specific interest is hromadas' resiliance to full-scale russian invasion launched on 2022-02-24.
