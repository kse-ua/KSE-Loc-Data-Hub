# De-centralization Reform in Ukraine

The project focuses on understanding the decentralization reform in Ukraine (2014 - 2021), its unfolding and effects on economic, demographic, and psychosocial features of local communities, specifically their resiliance to the ongoing russian agression. 

# Synopsis

Before 2014, Ukraine's administrative structure included 4 nested levels: settlement, rada (N=11,250) , raion (N = 136),  and oblast (N=24). The decentralization reformed launched in 2014, over the course of 7 years, amalgomated radas (local councils) into  hromadas (N = 1,496), replacing the administrative structure with "settlement-hromada-raion-oblast".

# Research Questions

- How did the process of amalgomation unfold over time and what features of comprising radas are related to decision to amalgomate?
- Does hromada's choice to amalgomate affects macroeconomic and psychosocial features of the region? 
- Does amalgomation make hromadas more resilient to foreign invasion?
