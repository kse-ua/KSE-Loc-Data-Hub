# Decentralization Reform in Ukraine (2014 -2022)


[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15267573.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15267573)


The project investigates the effects of restructurization of local councils (i.e. "rada", N = 11,250) into amalgamated territorial communities (i.e. "hromada", N = 1,469) and the effect of this tranformation on key macroeconomic and social indicators. Of specific interest is hromadas' **resiliance to full-scale russian invasion launched on 2022-02-24.**

This repository contains all the materials used to study the factors of resilience of Ukrainian communities in the context of the Russian invasion.

Another goal of the project is to create a repository of data available in Ukraine at the hromada level for further use in research and policy-making.

The project is funded by GIZ within its project "Support to the Decentralisation Reform in Ukraine (UDU U-LEAD with Europe. Phase II) (#`81281025`)

# Repository Structure

The repository has the following structure:

-   **data-public**:

    -   **data-public/raw**: a folder with initial data on hromadas obtained from open sources or through requests to government agencies

    -   **data-public/derived**: a folder with the final data that we received after processing the initial data with scripts (aggregation of data at the hromada level and calculation of new metrics)

-   **manipulation**: all the scripts which are used for data transformation of the raw data (the content of data-public/derived is a product of these scripts)

-   **analysis**: scripts for data analysis and data presentation within the project

-   **scripts**: useful functions for data wrangling/analysis

## Surveys

The Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Institute conducted two surveys of hromadas in 2022 to study the impact of Russia's full-scale invasion on their economic performance and to identify factors of hromada resilience to various types of war-related shocks. The datasets of surveys results are nor available on the repository due to the sensitivity of some data.

You can contribute using [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) or other [GUI tools](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md#tutorials-using-other-tools) (_more convenient option_).

## Fork this repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/kse-ua/KSE-Loc-Data-Hub/blob/main/additional-materials/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.
Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone https://github.com/kse-ua/KSE-Loc-Data-Hub.git
```
where "https://github.com/kse-ua/KSE-Loc-Data-Hub.git" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/kse-ua/KSE-Loc-Data-Hub/blob/main/additional-materials/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

For example:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-name/KSE-Loc-Data-Hub.git
```

where your-name is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the KSE-Loc-Data-Hub repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd KSE-Loc-Data-Hub
```
Now create a branch using the git switch command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```
For example:

```
git switch -c add-new-dataset
```

## Make changes and commit those changes

To make a commit to this project, follow these steps:

1. Make the necessary changes to the dataset, whether it's updating existing data or adding new data.

2. Save the dataset with your changes.

3. If you're adding a completely new dataset to the repository, place the dataset in the appropriate directory within the project.

4. To see the changes, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute the command `git status` to see the changes.

5. Use the following command to add the changes to your branch if you modified an existing dataset:
   
   ```
   git add your-dataset-filename
   ```
   
   Replace `your-dataset-filename` with the name of the dataset you modified.

6. If you're adding a completely new dataset, use the following command to add all new and modified files:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

7. Commit the changes with a descriptive message using the following command:
   
   ```
   git commit -m "Add/Update data in your-dataset-filename"
   ```
   Be sure to replace `your-dataset-filename` with the name of the dataset you worked on.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command git push:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing your-branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier.
